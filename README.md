# proactive-operations-forecasting


This project is a proposal-level demonstration of a proactive operations management concept.

The goal is to show how current work-in-progress data can be used to **predict potential SLA risks**, **simulate what-if scenarios**, and **support better operational decisions** before issues occur.

## What this includes
- A lightweight frontend dashboard (React + TypeScript) showing:
  - Operations overview
  - What-if simulation
  - Suggested actions
- A simple backend simulation model (Python / Colab) used to estimate SLA risk using mock data
